Changes made:

Box Shadow: Added a subtle box shadow (box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) to the preview box for a modern, lifted effect.
Background Color: Set the background color of the preview box to white (background-color: #fff) for better contrast and readability.
Border Color: Changed the border color to a lighter shade (#ddd) for a softer look.
Image Styling: Made the image centered with margin-bottom for a cleaner layout.
Error Message Styling: Styled error messages in red for immediate attention.

Reasoning for the Improvements:

The added styles improve the visual appeal of the preview box, making it more distinct and attractive.
The modifications enhance the readability and clarity of the content.
The consistent styling of links and error messages aligns with standard web practices, aiding in user experience.
